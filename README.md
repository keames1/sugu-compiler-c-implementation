# sugu-compiler-c-implementation
The c version of the compiler/interpreter. After the algorithms and design details are sorted out, it turns into c code and ends up here.

I am designing a new systems language designed to make system level programming more accessible. Similarly to how python made scripting more accessible to those interested in programming, I want to do the same for system programming/writing compiled code for high performance applications. I'm still working out the details of the syntax while I iron out the details of the lexer and lay some kind of ground work for parser design.

The python prototype code can be found in this repository: https://github.com/keames1/Sugu-compiler-python-prototype
I'm still doing a lot of leg work before I start to code the lexer proper in c.
